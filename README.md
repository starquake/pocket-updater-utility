A free utility for updating the openFPGA cores, firmware, and a bunch of other stuff on your Analogue Pocket.

A complete list of available cores can also be found here: [https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/](https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/)

I can't (and don't want to) support old versions, so please make sure you download the latest release before submitting any issues.

  

## Easy Mode ##

If you just want to use this utility, do not clone the source repository. Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility/releases/latest/). Unzip it, put the executable file for your platform (windows, mac os, or linux) in the root of your sd card, and run the program.

  

At the main menu run `Settings` to have it walk through the available settings for you.

## Important Menu Items ##

### Update All
Install/Update all of your cores, plus a bunch of other stuff. It can basically be used as the "do everything I want" option. Everything marked with a * can be turned on/off via settings.
1. Checks for new firmware updates *
2. Installs/updates every core you have selected
3. Checks for missing required assets for each core you have selected *
4. Deletes cores that you do not have selected *
5. Runs the instance JSON generator for each core you have selected (currently, only PC Engine CD) *
6. Rename every Jotego core you have selected *

### Update Firmware
Self explanatory. Just checks for firmware updates and exits.

### Download Required Assets
Checks for missing required assets for each core you have selected (mainly arcade ROM files and BIOSes)

### Core Selector

This will prompt you to ask if you want new cores installed by default, with 3 options:
 - Yes
   - Selecting this automatically chooses all existing cores, and will continue to automatically install new cores as they are released.
 - No
   - Selecting this means as new cores are released, they will not be installed automatically, nor will you be asked about them. Then you will be presented with a list of all currently available cores, to select from for yourself.
 - Ask
   - Selecting this means as new cores are released, you will be notified each time you run the app and have the option to select them for installation.  Then you will be presented with a list of all currently available cores, to select from for yourself.


### Download Image Packs

This will present you with a list of available image packs and automatically download and extract it to the Platforms/_images directory for you

  
  

### Generating Instance JSON Files

- Only supported by PC Engine CD, currently

- Put your games in /Assets/{platform}/common

- Each game needs to be in its own directory (and be sure to name the directory the full title of the game)

- Example: /Assets/pcecd/common/Rondo of Blood

- /Assets/pcecd/common/Bonk

- etc

- All games (for PC Engine CD) must be in cue/bin format. The generated json file will be saved using the same filename as the cue file, so be sure to also name that with the full title of the game

- When you run the `Generate Instance JSON Files` or `Update All` menu items, it will search through every directory in common and create a json file that can be launched by the core

- You can disable this process in Update All by setting `build_instance_jsons` to `false` in your settings file, if you don't want it to run every time you update.


### Jotego Beta Cores

Now that Jotego is releasing his beta cores publicly (and requiring a beta key to play them), you can just drop the `jtbeta.zip` file from patreon onto the root of your sd card and run Update All, and it will automatically copy the beta key to the correct folders for the cores that need it. It also will let you install the yhe cores directly from the updater, now. Make sure you don't rename the file, it's going to look for exactly `jtbeta.zip`

  

### How to build game and watch roms that are compatible with the pocket

Create 2 new folders.

`/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/artwork` and `/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/roms`

  

Place your `[artwork].zip` files into the artwork folder and your `[rom]`.zip files into the roms folder

  

Should look like this:

  

```

/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/artwork/gnw_dkong.zip

/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/roms/gnw_dkong.zip

```

  

Now just run the menu option in the updater and it will build your games

  

## Troubleshooting

 - Slow asset downloads? Try toggling `use_custom_archive` to true, in your settings.

  

 - If you run the update process and get a message like `Error in framework RS: bridge not responding` when running a core, try to run the updater in a local folder on your pc, and then copy the files over to the sd card afterwards. I'm not entirely sure what the issue is, but I've seen it reported a bunch of times now and running the updater locally seems to help.

 - I keep getting a `Missing ROM ID [1]` message when trying to launch arcade games in the _alternatives folder.

    Check your settings and make sure you have `Skip Alternative ROMS` turned off.
